# Adrastie NixOS Unreal Dev Env

Moving my Unreal Engine Dev Env to an ugly FHS flake.

Not made to be pretty, tailored for my needs. Targeting my workstation with an nvidia gpu and rider, made public for upcomming gamesjam.


# You are responsible for the proper use of this flake. I decline all responsibility for any damages that may result from the use of this flake.

## Take a look on the scripts before usage as some of them do contain unsecure functions and 'rm -rvf'!
